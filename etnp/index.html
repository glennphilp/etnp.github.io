  <h2>Defining Zones:</h2>
  <p>As a committee it is important to have a clear understanding of what Zoning can and cannot accomplish:</p>
  <div class="grid two-up">
    <div class="grid__cell">
      <h3>Can</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Regulate property usage</li>
        <li>Setbacks &amp; height</li>
        <li>Sidewalk requirements</li>
        <li>Landscaping</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="grid__cell">
      <h3>Cannot</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Regulate total square feet</li>
        <li>Regulate land value</li>
        <li>Regulate the price of a property</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Members should ask themselves where they see their block and then this neighborhood in 5 to 10 years. Zoning is a long-term investment. Keep in mind that too many restrictions can halt improvements in the area.</p>
  <p>Remember we will be held responsible for the betterment of the neighborhood. Zoning will not force someone to sell their property or lose money. It also cannot keep a million from buying a cheap piece of land. A property owner could simply decide to sit on the property&mdash;as many did between 1990's to 2000's. As a committee, do we want to stop the progress and growth of making this community more united?</p>
  <p>The following sections are broken down by potential zones. All committee members should go through independently to decide if they agree with this zoning break-down, keep what we currently have, or create different boundaries. </p>
  <p>Members should ask themselves: (especially if they do not reside in the zone)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the typical home in the suggested zone? The average square feet, how much of the property does it utilize?</li>
    <li>What is the average lot size?</li>
    <li>How many stories is the average home?</li>
    <li>Is the majority single-family, duplex, multiplex?</li>
    <li>Are the majority home owner or rentals properties?</li>
  </ul>

    <div class="section__header"><h2>Zone 8</h2></div>
    <div>
      <p>In order to support the neighborhoods concern about increasing property values, it is important to diversify the neighborhoods offering. This zone which experiences the highest transient population near Mockingbird, could benefit the neighborhood by becoming a multiplex zone. This would allow more homes per lot providing a way for developers to offer new home owners a chance to live in the heart of Dallas.</p>
      <h3>Zone Definitions</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Zone boundaries</dt>
        <dd>Beginning on Roper with Linnet to the north and Mockingbird to the south. Then expanding this zone from Tyree to the west, Roper to the east, Savage to the north and Mockingbird to the south</dd>
        <dt>Property break-down</dt>
        <dd>2 duplexes built in 2018/9, with a new duplex being started on Victoria as we speak. There is one church and one non-profit commercial space in this area. There are 11 empty lots, 1 community center, 3 churches, 1 non-profit commercial space, and 3 parking lot</dd>
        <dt>Property Usage</dt>
        <dd>Currently a total of 30 homes exists in this zone, in addition to all the empty lots, parking lots, churches, and commercial space.</dd>
      </dl>
      <h3>Zone requirements</h3>
      <p>Setbacks and amount of property used would need appropriate guidance as multiplex space has different requirements than homes. Restricting multiplexes to have rear-entry garage/parking, would allow for proper street parking. Require sidewalks, grass sod and landscaping.</p>

  <h2>Additional Questions &amp; Comments</h2>
  <p>Per the Fair Housing Act, can the City of Dallas regulate the home buyer based on income level? It is unclear the intentions of the neighbors serving on this committee. My understanding of zoning is it creates fair balance. As of 2016 this neighborhood is 43% Hispanic, 32% African-American, and 19% Caucasian, 3% Asian, and 3% unidentified.</p>
  <p>There have been multiple mentions that restricting the utilization of a property can slow property values and taxation.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Which neighborhoods in Dallas have seen the suggested setbacks, like Mark is mentioning?</li>
    <li>Who benefits from these restrictions and who gets hurt?</li>
    <li>What is the average home size in those areas?</li>
    <li>Does it stop a millionaire from purchasing the property?</li>
    <li>What is the current market value of those homes?</li>
    <li>By how much did it reduce property cost and taxation?</li>
    <li>What do those neighborhoods look like today?</li>
    <li>What are the negative impacts of such restrictions?</li>
  </ul>
